    <h1><strong>Blog Entry for Thursday, February 27, 2020.</strong></h1>
    <p>Here's a crazy story. </p>
    <p>Yesterday, my daughter comes home from school eager to show me a video. We let her take her phone to school in case of emergencies, with the understanding that it is to stay off until she is on the bus.</p>
    <p>So she shows me this recording she made while on the busride home of an altercation involving my nephew and another young boy.</p>
    <p>My nephew was sitting there and the other boy was calling him names and picking on him. Then the young boy pushed my nephew. He did not take it well and pushed him back. Things escalated from there when the young boy slapped him, so my nephew slaps him back and the both start swinging. The video ends with my nephew on top of the young boy punching him.</p>
    <p>Now, i was proud of my nephew for taking up for himself, but other than that, i didn't think much more about the video.</p>
    <p>That is until a little while ago when my wife calls me slightly upset that the principle of my daughters school had seen the video (a different one, not the one my daughter filmed but of the same altercation) and asked my daughter to give her phone.</p>
    <p>My daughter has respect for people in positions of authority generally, so she obliged. So the principle said she ants my wife to come to the school and delete the video.</p>
    <p>Now, i understand that there are privacy concerns, The parents of the young boy may not want their son plastered on YouTube or WorldStar. However, i was concerned for my daughter's privacy also.</p>
    <p>I don't understand how my daughters' privacy was not violated by having her phone confiscated and being made to delete the video. I understand that FERPA says that they can confiscate the phone if it causes a substantial disruption, but i don't believe that's the case here.</p>
    <p>One would assume the 4th Amendment would come into play here: Freedom from an illegal search and seizure. Although my daughter gave permission for her phone to be confiscated, i'm not sure how that applies to permission to alter the contents of her phone.</p>
    <p>I spoke to her principle and she assured me that her phone was not confiscated, that she was given permission to take the phone. That's fine, but how can you MAKE her delete a video from her phone? I asked.</p>
    <p>I was told that she could not technically make anyone delete the video, but that if we were sued because the video ended up online, the school would not be liable. Understandable.</p>
    <p>Still, though, this whole ordeal rubbed me the wrong way. If schools can take our children's property away because it causes a disruption and make them alter the contents, then what other rights are schools infringing on?</p>
    <p>Maybe as a parent we tend to overreact, but this really aggravated me.</p>
